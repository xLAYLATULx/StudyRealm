 Final Year Project - Student Time Management App

This is a web app that aims to help university students manage their time effectively. The main functions of the system are a Goals page to set goals, a Task Manager page with projects, a Pomodoro page where the timer is adjustable, and a Schedule page that integrates the goals and tasks as events. This app should allow students to record deadlines, visualise progress, and plan their time.

No SQL file needs to be imported, the app is built from Laravel so please follow the Laravel documentation to migrate the database files and run the application.
